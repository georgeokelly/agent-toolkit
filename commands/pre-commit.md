# Pre-Commit: Draft a git commit command

Analyze staged changes and produce a copy-pasteable `git commit` command. **Do NOT execute `git commit` directly.**

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Gather changes

Run `git diff --cached --stat` and `git diff --cached`.

- **If changes are staged**: use the staged diff as the basis for Steps 2-4.
- **If nothing is staged**: fall back to `git diff` and `git status` to find unstaged/untracked changes.
  - If there are no changes at all, inform the user and **stop here**.
  - Otherwise, use the unstaged diff as the basis for Steps 2-4. In Step 4, prepend a `git add` command before the `git commit` command so the user can copy and run both in sequence.

### Step 2 — README Sync Check

Follow the README Sync Check procedure defined in the project's git commit rules (git.mdc / CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md). This is a **blocking** check — do not proceed to Step 3 until the user either confirms README updates or explicitly skips them.

### Step 3 — Draft commit message

Read the project's git commit message conventions (git.mdc / CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md), then:

1. Analyze the diff to understand the logical changes (not file-by-file).
2. Draft a commit message following the documented format (imperative title + grouped body).
3. Evaluate Co-authorship: add the `Co-authored-by` trailer only when warranted per the rules.

### Step 4 — Output the command

Present copy-pasteable commands using HEREDOC format.

**When changes were already staged:**

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<title>

<body>

[Co-authored-by: ...]
EOF
)"
```

**When nothing was staged (fallback to unstaged changes):**

```bash
git add <files> && git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<title>

<body>

[Co-authored-by: ...]
EOF
)"
```

The `git add` portion should list the specific files from the unstaged diff, or use `git add -A` if all changes should be included.

Do NOT run these commands. The user will review and execute them.
