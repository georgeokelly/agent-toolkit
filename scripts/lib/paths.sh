# lib/paths.sh — Per-project artifact path constants.
# Sourced by agent-sync.sh AND agent-check.sh after $PROJECT_DIR is set.
#
# Centralizing these declarations means that adding a new tool or artifact
# requires touching exactly one file rather than two parallel source-of-
# truth declarations (agent-sync used to define them inline at top, and
# agent-check used to re-declare local aliases like CC_SKILLS_MF). The
# previous arrangement was a known maintenance hazard — see review M3.
#
# Convention: `*_MANIFEST` paths point at the per-tool manifest file; each
# manifest enumerates the artifacts agent-sync owns under that subtree so
# stale-cleanup is precise. `*_STAMP` paths are sentinel touch-files used
# where in-file marker gating is impractical (e.g. .codex/config.toml).
#
# All variables are unconditional: even when a tool's mode is `off`, the
# corresponding manifest path is still defined here so set -u doesn't trip
# defensive sub-blocks that read these names. Whether a manifest *file*
# actually exists at the path is checked by callers via `[ -f ... ]`.
