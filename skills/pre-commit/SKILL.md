# Pre-Commit

Analyze staged changes and produce a copy-pasteable `git commit` command.
**Do NOT execute `git commit` directly.**

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Gather changes

Run `git diff --cached --stat` and `git diff --cached`.

- **If changes are staged**: use the staged diff as the basis for Steps 2-4.
- **If nothing is staged**: fall back to `git diff` and `git status` to find
  unstaged/untracked changes.
  - If there are no changes at all, inform the user and **stop here**.
  - Otherwise, use the unstaged diff as the basis for Steps 2-4. In Step 4,
    prepend a `git add` command before the `git commit` command so the user
    can copy and run both in sequence.

### Step 2 — README Sync Check

Follow the README Sync Check procedure defined in the project's git commit
rules (git.mdc / CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md). This is a **blocking** check — do
not proceed to Step 3 until the user either confirms README updates or
explicitly skips them.

### Step 3 — Draft commit message

Read the project's git commit message conventions (git.mdc / CLAUDE.md /
AGENTS.md), then:

1. Analyze the diff to understand the logical changes (not file-by-file).
2. Draft a commit message following the documented format (imperative title
   + grouped body).
3. Evaluate Co-authorship: add the `Co-authored-by` trailer only when
   warranted per the rules.

### Step 4 — Output the command

Write the commit message to a file under `/tmp/`, then run
`git commit -F` against that file. Do **NOT** use the
`git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF' ... EOF)"` nested-heredoc form —
terminals frequently mis-parse nested command substitution,
multi-line heredocs, and special characters (arrows, em-dashes,
backticks, angle-bracket placeholders). Writing the message to a
file first sidesteps the entire quoting problem and makes the
message inspectable / retry-able after a failed commit.

Output three commands as separate fenced blocks so the user runs
them one by one and can inspect the message between steps:

**1. Write message file** (single heredoc that only feeds `cat`,
not nested inside another command substitution):

```bash
cat > /tmp/commit-msg-<topic>.txt <<'EOF'
<title>

<body>

[Co-authored-by: ...]
EOF
```

**2a. Commit when changes were already staged:**

```bash
git commit -F /tmp/commit-msg-<topic>.txt
```

**2b. Commit when nothing was staged (fallback to unstaged changes):**

```bash
git add <files> && git commit -F /tmp/commit-msg-<topic>.txt
```

The `git add` portion should list the specific files from the
unstaged diff, or use `git add -A` if all changes should be included.

**3. Clean up the temp file** (output as a separate command so the
message survives a failed commit and stays inspectable for retry):

```bash
rm /tmp/commit-msg-<topic>.txt
```

Filename convention: `/tmp/commit-msg-<short-topic>.txt` (e.g.
`commit-msg-install-sh.txt`) so multiple parallel commits don't
collide on the same temp file.

Do NOT run any of these commands. The user will review and execute
them.
